        <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p>My name is Brian Hook and I am an aspiring software engineer in Thinkful's Engineering Coding Bootcamp.I am  using my previous 6+ years of Search Engine Optimization and Web Development experience to springboard into a new coding career!</p>
      </section>
      <section id="about">
        <h2>More About Myself</h2>
          <p>I became interested in coding when I saw how complex problems could be solved with simple solutions. While I sometimes enjoy the challenge of relying on myself to work through road-blocks, I would rather collaborate with others to share knowledge and new perspectives that help everyone involved.</p>
          <p>I also have many other interests, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brianhook/">wildlife photography</a></li>
              <li>music / recording</li>
              <li>hanging out with my free-range rabbit</li>
            </ul>
          <!-- TO DO add three side by side photos representing interests -->
          <br />
          <p>FUN FACT: I grew up in a town an hour north of Chicago and still reside nearby in the vibrant, yet sadly vibranium-less, Wauconda(forever), IL.</p>
