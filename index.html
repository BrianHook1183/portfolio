        <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Brian Hook and I am an aspiring software engineer in Thinkful's Engineering Coding Bootcamp.I am  using my previous 6+ years of Search Engine Optimization and Web Development experience to springboard into a new coding career!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I became interested in coding when I saw how complex problems could be solved with simple solutions. While I sometimes enjoy the challenge of relying on myself to work through road-blocks, I would rather collaborate with others to share knowledge and new perspectives that help everyone involved.</p>
          <!-- TO DO replace music link with a link to my music somehow? have picture or funny bunny ear animation or something for rabbit. OR each of my interests has a picture of me doing those things to the side of the content -->
          <p>I also have many other interests, including <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brianhook/">wildlife photography</a>, <a href="https://flic.kr/p/5yJRT4">music / recording</a>, and hanging out with my free-range rabbit.</p>
          <p>I grew up an hour north of Chicago in Lake Villa, IL, and currently reside in vibrant yet vibranium-less Wauconda, IL (forever)</p> <!-- TO DO add in a picture or give of black panther? -->
